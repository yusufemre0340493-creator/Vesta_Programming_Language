# Vesta Programming Language
*In this project, I created a programming language. Currently, it only includes basic things like printing to the screen and variables. I will develop these further in the future.*
> **Example code that you can run is located in the example_code file; you can check it there.**

Vesta is an experimental programming language designed with a focus on simplicity, readability, and ease of learning. It is especially suitable for beginners who want to understand how programming languages work and for developers interested in building their own language.

This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
